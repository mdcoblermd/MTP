# MTP
We have 12 published Jupyter notebooks.

4 represent the code used to optimize hyperparmeters for our four models (MTP admission, MTP 4 hours, UMT admission, UMT 4 hours).
4 contain the code used to generate and evaluate the models after hyperparmeter tuning.
The final 4 contain the code used to compare final models against LASSO models
